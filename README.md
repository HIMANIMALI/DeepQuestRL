# DeepQuestRL
DeepQuestRL is an end-to-end Deep Q-Learning playground: vanilla DQN and upgraded Double/Dueling/PER agents built from scratch in PyTorch, solving Wumpus World, CartPole, a custom grid task, and Atari Breakout. Includes prioritized replay, target nets, Îµ-scheduling, rich plots, and SB3 benchmarks.
